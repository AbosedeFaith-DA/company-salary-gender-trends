# Project Objective
he objective of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of employee salary patterns and gender distribution across various departments within the ‘employees’ database. By examining average salaries, comparing male and female compensation trends over time, and assessing department-specific data, this analysis aims to uncover insights into gender-based salary trends and support data-driven decisions regarding pay equity and workforce composition.

# Question

-Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. 
-Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.
-Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.
-Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.
Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.

 # Project Insights
The average salary for male employees generally surpasses that of female employees across most departments. However, specific departments like Customer Service and Production show closer salary parity.
Salary trends for both male and female employees indicate consistent growth from 1990 through 2002 across departments, though male salaries tend to have a slightly steeper increase.
Prior to 1993, male and female salaries were relatively similar across departments. Post-1993, male employees consistently receive higher average salaries than female employees.
Departments like Sales and Finance tend to have the highest average salaries across both genders, while Customer Service and Human Resources show more moderate levels.

# Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals a persistent gender-based salary gap within the organization, with male employees generally earning higher salaries than their female counterparts, especially from 1993 onwards. Salary growth trends are steady across departments, reflecting a positive organizational growth trajectory. This data-driven overview highlights areas where gender-based salary adjustments may be beneficial, promoting equity within the workforce.
